# The dashboard

A local web page over a coordinator's event log: issues and their status, decisions waiting on you, agent runs, estimated spend, the land queue, deploys and reports. It listens on `127.0.0.1` only and every API call needs the dashboard's token, which is in the URL it prints.

## For a project checkout

```bash
worklane dashboard            # from inside the checkout, or with --root <dir>
```

It reads the checkout's own log and opens the browser on port 4317.

## For an instance on an always-on machine

An instance's log lives in its coordinator user's home, which only that user can read. So the dashboard runs as that user, on the machine where the instance runs:

```bash
bash scripts/setup/dashboard.sh <name> [<your GitHub login>]
```

- It starts `worklane dashboard --instance <name> --no-open` as `wl-<name>`, in the foreground (Ctrl+C stops it).
- The port is fixed by the instance's name (4400-4899), so a tunnel set up once keeps working. `--port` on the CLI overrides it.
- Your GitHub login decides which decisions you may answer (yours, or any if you're one of the project's writers). Without it, the dashboard acts as the project's default owner.
- Answers are recorded in that instance's log, as its coordinator user, like `decide` on the command line.

### From another machine: an ssh tunnel

The dashboard never listens on the network. To open it from your laptop, forward the same port over ssh:

```bash
ssh -N -L <port>:127.0.0.1:<port> <you>@<always-on-host>
```

Then open the URL `dashboard.sh` printed (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/?t=<token>`) on the laptop. The page moves the token out of the address bar on load. The token is stored in the instance's state directory, so it stays the same across restarts; delete `dashboard-token` there to issue a new one.

Each instance has its own port and token: run one `dashboard.sh` and one tunnel per instance.

## All instances in one view: the hub

To see every instance on the machine from one page and one tunnel, an admin reviews and runs, once:

```bash
sudo bash scripts/setup/dashboards.sh <your GitHub login> <name> [<name>...]
```

- Each instance gets its own dashboard service, `worklane-dashboard-<name>.service`, running as `wl-<name>`. It's the only process that reads that instance's log and records answers in it. It replaces running `dashboard.sh` in a terminal; don't run both, because they use the same port.
- A viewer user, `wl-dash`, runs the hub, `worklane-dashboard-hub.service`, on port 4399. The page shows an instance switcher, and every call, answers included, is forwarded to the selected instance's own dashboard, which applies its own checks.
- `wl-dash` can read each instance's `dashboard-token` file and traverse the directories leading to it, through ACLs. It can't list those directories, read any log, config or credential, or write anything outside its own home. The script checks all of this before it finishes. No instance user gets new access, so no instance can read or write another's log.
- The hub never hands an instance's token to the browser. You only ever hold the hub's token, which the script prints.

From the laptop, one tunnel for all of them:

```bash
ssh -N -L 4399:127.0.0.1:4399 <you>@<always-on-host>
```

Then open the hub URL the script printed. After adding an instance, run the script again with the full list.

## The web UI

The engine install (`scripts/setup/engine.sh`) builds the UI into `dist/web`. In a source checkout, run `npm run build:web`. Without it the page says the UI isn't built.
